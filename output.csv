"For me, for the most part, is delivery. Simply because it's fast, it's convenient.

"It's narrowed down like it's selections of food that it has. So when it narrows it down, sometimes I don't want to eat a burger for the most part. Sometimes they have like mostly pork and we don't eat pork like that. Other times it's like it's maybe something that I'm not interested in eating. So I'll just like skip the week for the most part. But I do want to like try different meals and try different things. But it also it makes it hard because it's always like rotated meals. It's nothing like that's new that stands out. That's different that I haven't heard about none of those. So I'm just like not interested when it comes to it. For the most part I'll get it like maybe like every other month or something, but it's also still very rare.",meal boxes,0.9,Caregiver,P6 Jorie M
"About like two weeks, but it wasn't like consistently every week. I'll just see it 'cause if I don't like that week's meal plans or anything, I'll just skip it. And if I'm not around, I'll just skip it. But also like if we are not on the same page when it comes like those meals, it's kind of like a waste of money, a waste of time and everything. And also the meals can be pretty expensive. I think it's like 3 meals for $50.00 and it says for like one to two people, it's only fit for like one person if if anything, you know, So it's not something that it's like for a family to feed a whole family or even last 'cause it has to be like small tiny plates if anything.",meal boxes,0.95,Caregiver,P6 Jorie M
"It's like it just doesn't flow and it doesn't fit. But I do like certain things that's there, like they're add-ons, like the pieces that they have, those add-ons are pretty good in like the cheesecakes.

"So I like the like Buffalo pizza. It was like a bread. I forgot the type of bread. It was like a bread type of pizza, like a flat bread. And then also they have like the cheesecake. The cheesecake is really good. So we like that one too. And then they're brownies, we like that one too. So we just tried to like try different things and they're adding on many different things, but sometimes it just isn't. It doesn't taste all that good sometimes.",what do they order,0.9,Caregiver,P6 Jorie M
"Yeah, but I do like like that it comes, everything comes packaged, it comes in its own bag, stuff like that. It makes it so much easier for you to just have everything together when you're cooking. And I like the portions if it's like for one person, but not portions for three people, you know, But it makes sense. Like they have like the rice and it comes with like the packets that are best fit for like that size. And like everything is good. It's not over salty or over seasoned or anything.",meal boxes,0.9,Caregiver,P6 Jorie M
"So whenever like we have like any holidays or anything, we just like order anything that's different outside of like what we're cooking from home and tend to go with like the family meals that's on like Grubhub that has like the different, like it'll be like a pasta place that's next door. And it would say like the family meals, it's on the bottom. So we just order for like the family meals, get it delivered outside of like what we're cooking. It's something that's different that we don't tend to have at home, stuff like that.",when family orders/ how often,0.9,Caregiver,P6 Jorie M
It's both. So tend to be like holidays when I'm meeting with like my parents and my extended family holidays too and also like family because it does give us a bit. Some leftovers can also pack you for like lunch the next day or something. So it does leave us enough food.,when family orders/ how often,0.9,Caregiver,P6 Jorie M
"And also sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not. It depends, like the place we get it from and stuff. Yeah, 'cause some places they do make like family meals. You can even order it there. It's catering meals basically for the most part.",food delivery,0.8,Caregiver,P6 Jorie M
"Well, it wasn't like in a sense of like catering, but it was more so like family meals and stuff. I would say like it's like catering because it's bigger meal plans and bigger stuff on there and then what we typically have like just like the individual meals and everything.",meal planning,0.8,Caregiver,P6 Jorie M
"Yeah. So that's like, but it's it gets expensive. It can be up to like $100 for like the whole thing, but sometimes it could be pretty expensive. So it's something that we also save for like holidays and gatherings, like family gatherings and stuff.",food delivery,0.8,Caregiver,P6 Jorie M
"Budgeting for food delivery at times, at times, but it depends on like what exactly we're getting. So at times I do think about like the budgeting and stuff. Sometimes it's kind of like, yeah, don't care. Let's just reward ourselves and eat as much as like we want to or order at like whatever price we want to at this point. But then sometimes we're just like, yeah, let's stay in this range within like less than 50 'cause I mean, they do have like a good portion when it comes like we're ordering from and all of that.",food delivery,0.9,Caregiver,P6 Jorie M
"It just depends, like from being more like spontaneous of like what we want to get. And I'm like, Oh yeah, let's just go like whatever we want, whatever we're in the mood for stuff like, rather than just like, Oh yeah, let's just stick to this. Let's just stick to that one and, you know, just doing different things each time.",decisions on ordering,0.9,Caregiver,P6 Jorie M
"It's not like anytime I'm ordering something, it's not like, Oh yeah, so we stay underneath this budget or something. I'm always, at times, I'm always conscious of like what I'm purchasing. So sometimes like, let me just be spontaneous.",rules,0.8,Caregiver,P6 Jorie M
"Sometimes I'm not like interested in it because I don't know, like how they're getting it and everything, like how it's made. Unless like it's something that I'm like, I like this place and I understand like how it is. I've been there before or something. You know, 'cause I do Grubhub, I just do the pickup instead of like delivery. I just get it picked up. So it depends, depends on like the places or things like if you know like it's clean, sanitary level and everything.",food delivery,0.9,Caregiver,P6 Jorie M
"Most of them is fast food places. Yeah, most of them is fast food places. I like Chick-fil-A. We like Chick-fil-A, but most of them is like fast food places cause other the places they're like just like small mom and dad pop shops and then like small like fine restaurants that I've either been to like before inside and I just want to get it delivered. But most of the places I'm just like, it's the fast food places if anything.",what do they order,0.9,No Tag Group,P6 Jorie M
"So for me, fast food is more so like anything that offers a tractor for me for the most part. But I mean, I would still consider Chick-fil-A underneath fast food because you get it real fast. They don't care, they just throw it in there and everything. But it's still like on the better end of the fast food if anything, if that makes sense. So the typical fast foods like Sonic, if it still exists out here, McDonald's, Burger King, Jack-in-the-box, all those corner foods that you can just get at any time that you want to get them at. They do have some that's dining that's fast food, like Chipotle and stuff like that. Those are the ones that are fast that you can always get at any time in and out burgers. And then the other ones that they're taking more time. These are more so like the casual dinings, fine dinings and stuff. So all of that really just depends on like how they're cooking it and everything, like what's going on.",food delivery,0.8,Caregiver,P6 Jorie M
"I try and stay away from most of the fast foods, but we like Chick-fil-A and then maybe like Shake Shack, that's very close to like the fast food too, but it's a little on the other side. So I try to stay away from like McDonald's, Burger King, Jack of the Ox, Checkered, all those places there, they lean towards like the restaurants, the casual dining and stuff like that, that getting those made and then they're more seasoned, they're better. It's almost like cooking it at home by you just ordering it online, stuff like that. And also some satellite places that we like.
